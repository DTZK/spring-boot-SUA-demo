AdminService.java - Authentication Logic
**Purpose:** Verifies admin credentials during login.

**What it does:**
- Stores admin username and password hash (from `application.properties`)
- `authenticate()` method checks if provided username/password match
- Uses `PasswordEncoder` to securely compare passwords (hashed)

**Example:**
```
User submits: username="admin", password="secret123"
↓
AdminService checks:
- Does username match? ✓
- Does passwordEncoder.matches("secret123", storedHash)? ✓
↓
Returns true → Login successful → Generate JWT
```

## **How They Work Together**

### **Login Flow:**
1. User sends credentials to `/api/auth/login`
2. **AdminService** validates username/password
3. If valid, **JwtUtil** generates a token
4. Token returned to user

### **Protected Request Flow:**
1. User sends request to `/api/admin/users` with JWT in header
2. **JwtAuthenticationFilter** intercepts request
3. Extracts and validates token using **JwtUtil**
4. Sets authentication in Spring Security context
5. **SecurityConfig** checks authorization rules
6. If user has ROLE_ADMIN → Request proceeds
7. If not → 403 Forbidden

### **Security Layers:**
```
Request
  ↓
JwtAuthenticationFilter (validates token, sets authentication)
  ↓
SecurityConfig (checks if user has required role)
  ↓
Controller (handles business logic)
