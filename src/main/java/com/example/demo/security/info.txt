1. JwtUtil.java - JWT Token Manager
Purpose: Handles JWT (JSON Web Token) operations.
What it does:

Generates tokens: Creates a JWT when a user logs in successfully
Validates tokens: Checks if a token is valid and extracts the username from it
Uses a secret key to sign tokens (so they can't be forged)
Sets expiration time for tokens (tokens expire after a certain period)

Example flow:

User logs in → JwtUtil creates token → Token sent to user
User makes request with token → JwtUtil validates it → Extracts username

2. JwtAuthenticationFilter.java - Request Interceptor
**Purpose:** Intercepts every HTTP request to check for authentication.

**What it does:**
- Runs before every request reaches your controllers
- Looks for `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- If found, validates the token using `JwtUtil`
- If valid, sets the user as authenticated in Spring Security's context
- Passes the request along the filter chain

**Example:**
```
Request: GET /api/admin/users
Header: Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGc...
↓
Filter extracts "eyJhbGc..."
↓
Validates token → username = "admin"
↓
Sets authentication with ROLE_ADMIN
↓
Request proceeds to controller

3. SecurityConfig.java - Security Configuration

Purpose: Configures Spring Security for your application.
What it does:

Disables CSRF: Since you're using JWT (stateless), CSRF protection isn't needed
Configures CORS: Allows requests from specific origins (e.g., your frontend)
Sets session policy: Stateless (no server-side sessions, just JWT tokens)
Defines authorization rules:

/api/admin/** → Requires ROLE_ADMIN
/api/auth/** → Public (for login)
/api/public/** → Public
Everything else → Public


Adds JWT filter: Inserts JwtAuthenticationFilter before Spring's authentication filter
Provides PasswordEncoder: BCrypt for hashing passwords
